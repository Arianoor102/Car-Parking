This C++ code defines a parking management system using object-oriented programming. The code includes a parent class `Parking` with data members representing parking-related statistics, methods for adding two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and four-wheelers to the parking lot, as well as methods for displaying, deleting, and backing up parking records. Three child classes (`TwoWheel`, `ThreeWheel`, `FourWheel`) handle the specific functionality for each type of vehicle. The `ShowRecord` class combines the functionalities of all three classes to display the overall parking records. The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the parking system, allowing them to add vehicles, show records, delete records, provide feedback, and exit the program. Additionally, it includes colorful console output for a visually appealing interface.
